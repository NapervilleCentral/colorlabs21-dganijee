Critiqued by Chris Lew: 
"sf1 is creative, but I would recommend staying somewhat consistent with colors, that way the gradient will pop more and you can see some depth and shadows. Sf2 did that, but the colors don't vary in shade much so it doesn't give you depth. Sf3 is way better, you vary shades of the same color but they're lighter/darker than each other so it gives you depth."


My Personal Progression:
sf1 - I wanted to go for a thermal design, hence why I picked red, orange, green, yellow and blue. The problem I felt that is that you could only really see the depth if red/orange were next to each other. You couldn't get a sense of depth with colors that vary (like red and green). I felt like it clashed too much and wasn't as good as I imagined it being, so taking Chris' feedback I decided to switch to a more consistent color palette.

sf2 - I think I did a much better job with making the palette more consistent. You can start to see more depth, BUT I didn't vary the colors in shade enough. A lot of depth and shadows gets washed out because I didn't pick different enough shades.

sf3 - I tried to use lighter colors, but I think there can still be more variety. I stayed with the same shade of blue and messed around with different light/darker iterations of that shade in the RGB color picker, but I think if I used similar colors and also different shades of that color it would look a lot better. This is much better than sf2 but I can still make it better.

sf_FINAL_USE_THIS - I did a much better job, it is a much better and refined iteration compared to the last one. Each one of the five colors are very different In shade, despite all being blue. You can clearly see the depth in this picture, even seeing the cameras and the "lab rules" sign in the back. You can also see how the lighting hits my face based on the shades. I am way more proud of this piece than the other two.
